Cal Todo
========

This is a todo app based on a calendar.
The tricky part of calendar events is that they're fixed in time, but most of the time I want to complete a task "when I'm at home" or "during work hours" or similar. This requires a more flexible set of scheduling requirements.

1. Need to make a "calendar"
2. Need to be able to schedule events on the calendar (form)
3. Edit form
4. Sync with Dropbox (and with CloudKit probably)
5. Set alarms / notifications
